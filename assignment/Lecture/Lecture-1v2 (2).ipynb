    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first lesson in R programming! This lesson is designed for **complete beginners** with no prior coding experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn Today\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand what programming and R are\n",
    "- Create and use variables to store information\n",
    "- Perform basic calculations\n",
    "- Work with different types of data (numbers, text, lists)\n",
    "- Load data from files for analysis\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🤔 What is Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming** is simply giving instructions to a computer. Think of it like writing a recipe:\n",
    "- A recipe tells a person step-by-step how to cook a dish\n",
    "- A program tells a computer step-by-step how to complete a task\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why learn programming for data analysis?**\n",
    "- Automate repetitive tasks (analyze 1000 files the same way you'd analyze 1)\n",
    "- Handle large datasets that Excel can't manage\n",
    "- Create reproducible analyses (you can re-run your exact steps)\n",
    "- Perform advanced statistical analysis and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "**R** is a programming language designed specifically for:\n",
    "- Statistical analysis\n",
    "- Data visualization (charts, graphs)\n",
    "- Data manipulation and cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why R?**\n",
    "- Free and open-source\n",
    "- Huge community and thousands of add-on packages\n",
    "- Industry standard in many fields (academia, healthcare, finance)\n",
    "- Excellent for beginners in data analysis\n",

    "2. **Run code** by clicking a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`\n",
    "3. **See results** immediately below each code cell\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why use comments?**\n",
    "- Explain what your code does (for yourself and others)\n",
    "- Leave notes and reminders\n",

    "### What is a Variable?\n",

    "```r\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important naming rules:**\n",

    "- ✅ Can contain letters, numbers, underscores: `total_count`, `item1`\n",

    "- ❌ Avoid special characters: `my$data` won't work\n",
